Before going into inital findings, I wanted to note the differences between the two sets of data. The earlier data only containted the specific loan amounts for loans that were under $150k. Loans over that amount were put into 4 different categories but no specific amount was mentioned. There were other issues with the data as well but there was a succesful lawsuit and the SBA released the new data in the second link. It all seemed kinda sketchy to me. 
I have copied an article below.

Outlined below are some notable points about the data. 

116 of the Business names were not filled in
3,129 addresses were missing
132,940 did not have a code associated with the industry 
336,466 did not report how many jobs were associated with that business (596,090 also reported 0 while COUTLEE & SONS CONSTRUCTION in Hoonah Arkansas reported -6 Jobs. how?)


Now with that out of the way. Going into my initial analysis using the data from the second link 

## Main Points 

### BIG Numbers 

#### Number of Loans Made: 5,156,850
#### Total Amount of Money Distributed: 522,949,800,493.82

To put these values in perspective: In 2020, there were 31.7 million small businesses within the United States [sba](https://cdn.advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/04144224/2020-Small-Business-Economic-Profile-US.pdf) (so only 16.26% of small businesses recieved loans) and the total amount of Money Distributed is about 70.62% of the annual defense policy bill [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-intensifies-threat-to-veto-defense-authorization-bill-11607442143)

#### Jobs 
As I noted before, the jobs numbers will not be accurate as there was a sizable amount of missing data. So assuming that all missing data would have been one job, we arrive at a conservative estimate of 51,717,759

### Industries 
Pretty self explanitory. Restraunts coming in first makes sense but Offices of Lawyers recieved the third largest amount of money?
